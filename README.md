# Let's Get Started

You will need to install Quasar CLI first. This also requires that you have already installed [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/).

In your terminal, enter:

`$ npm install -g quasar-cli`

Once the installation is finished, you'll have a number of commands available. We are going to use the initialization script first.
