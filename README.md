# Introduction

This repo is built to be a tutorial, so you can learn how to work with Quasar and at the same time learn its basic concepts and features too.

In order to present to you the application in "pieces" and teach you how those pieces are made and why they are made in that way, this repo has a number of branches, starting with this introduction. Each branch is a chapter of the tutorial. 

Except for this Intro branch, every other branch is numbered. If you follow the numbers (which isn't a necessity) you can also learn as you go and see the app being built. We will end up with the final master branch, which holds the final and finished app. If you'd like, you can also start your own repo and simply follow along and save your progress as you go. You could think of that repo as your own first Quasar app.

## Prerequisites

If you aren't familiar with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), we highly recommend you dig into this framework's concepts and capabilities. It is a highly pragmatic, yet powerful view rendering system built for SPAs (single page applications), but can also be used for non-SPA scenarios too. You are going to need a fair understanding of Vue, for Quasar to make sense. 

If you'd like to invest a little bit of money on an excellent tutorial to learn Vue.js, take a look at this Udemy course by @mschwarzmueller (Max Schwarzm√ºller). It does into fine detail about Vue.

Other things you'll need experience with (note the minimum levels):

- [HTML](https://www.udemy.com/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/) (intermediate)
- [CSS](https://www.udemy.com/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/) (intermediate)
- [Stylus CSS System](http://stylus-lang.com/try.html) (beginner)
- [JavaScript](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-javascript-course/) (intermediate)
- [Webpack Workflow](https://www.udemy.com/webpack-2-the-complete-developers-guide/) and [Node.js](https://www.udemy.com/understand-nodejs/)(familiarization)
- Quasar (noob:smile:)

If any of the things mentioned above sound totally unfamiliar to you, I've linked them all to websites, which are meant to teach you the basics. As you can see, I've stuck to Udemy, and yes, they all cost money. This only means you can expect quality tutorials and know you are learning good stuff!

If you have any questions as we go on, please ask them in the [Quasar forum](http://forum.quasar-framework.org/). These questions will also be a source of learning for others. Don't be shy to ask questions, we all have to start somewhere!

## The Goal

We are going to be building an application called "Radiatum". It will be a Twitter clone, with basic functionality similar to Twitter. It is purely a demonstrative application and will not be production ready. 

The goal of the application will be to get you familiar with these areas of a Quasar applications.

- Authentication
- Templating and Application Structure
- Routing
- Data and Connectivity Management

## How the Tutorial Works 

If you want to following this locally, use git to work with the tutorial. 

Follow these commands. 

`git clone https://github.com/skooppaos/quasar-example-app-and-tutorial.git`

To see all the chapters (branches) enter this command:

`git show-branch -a`

This will show all the chapters. 

Each branch's README.md file is a chapter in the tutorial. If you'd like to move to the next chapter, simply enter this command (for example for the chapter "Let's Get Started")

`git checkout "1-0_-_Let's_Get_Started`"

Note: the double quotes are necessary, because of the single quote in the branch name.

Or just follow the lings on Github. :smile:

With that, [let's get started](https://github.com/skooppaos/quasar-example-app-and-tutorial/tree/1_-_Let's_Get_Started) and have some fun!
